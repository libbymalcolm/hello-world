Agile Project Management
An agile way of working means we do what makes sense and deliver the most value to the people we serve by focussing on delivering the best work, above following a project plan. Teams are empowered by Agile Project Managers to help change the project to get a better outcome. If you can see a better way, then as a team you should be empowered to speak up and make a difference.
