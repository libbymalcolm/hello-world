Digital Audit, Policy & Legislation
Last updated: Friday, 3rd November 2017 by Libby Malcolm

Digital transformation needs to be supported by legislation and regulation that enables innovation to flourish, while ensuring that the appropriate legal and regulatory safeguards are in place to manage the potential risks of digital technology, and protect privacy.

Effective legislative and regulatory frameworks are critical to enabling digital identity management; simplifying transactions; improving data collection and custodianship; and enabling the sharing of data to improve decision-making, policy development and service delivery.

As part of the digital transformation journey, there are three areas for the xxxx to focus on. First, existing legislative barriers will be removed where appropriate, respecting privacy considerations. In some cases this requires legislative amendment or clarification to enable the use of digital technology.○ Second, frameworks will be established to support new legislation that is digital by design. Legislation that is fit for the digital age does not preclude emerging technology and new digital business models. In its digital form, it is also easy to access and understand, in order to provide certainty to those who are subject to it. Regulations will also be able to be enforced through digital means.○ Finally, existing legislation will be reviewed to support the release of and access to better quality data.
