Digital Leadership

Last updated: Friday, 3rd November 2017 by Libby Malcolm

As the APSC evolves and transforms to better harness digital innovation and efficiency, it is essential that we build Digital Capability, not only within our Leadership Team but those that strive to be effective future leaders in a digitally open and transparent government.

SES Band Leaders strive to grow the capabilities of a Digital Leader, and to that end, a comprehensive Digital Leadership Training Program is already in inception. With an adaptive leadership team that is skilled to inspire, grow and change the way we deliver better value to the Australian people.

These are the qualities of a Digital Leader:

Is responsive in leadership style
Is customer satisfaction centred in all they do
Develops a culture of trust and transparency in Government
Is digitally fluent, constantly learning
Develops and evolves a digitally literate workforce
Has a personal appetite for change
Is inquisitive and seeks out evolved solutions
Promotes collaborative environments
Builds a professional network across agencies and industry
Drives organisational impact from Big Data in real time
Link to the Learning Development Standard
