This is an exciting time to work in the Australian Public Service.

Digital Capability Model V4.1

Five years from now, the Capability found within our workforce will look completely different to what it looks like now as we transform into a digitally-savvy government.

We are freeing up our people to deliver better services, processes and decisions for our constituents in a way that is unprecedented in the history of the Australian Federal Government. With the emergence of digital technology and leadership models, it has become essential that we recruit, train and retain our people in order to better deliver a transparent, service-driven and responsive Public Service.

The nature of technology is that it changes quickly, and that is why we need to change: so that we can pivot and adapt to make use of new and exciting tools. This isnâ€™t about just building websites, it is opening ourselves up to new ways of working.

We have already begun the process of changing from the inside out, but there is more work to do and exciting times ahead. To that end, we have brought together this Capability Framework to assist, guide and define the knowledge, skills, attributes required to be a world-class, digital organisation.
